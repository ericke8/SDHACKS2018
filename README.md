# SDHACKS2018

A program created for the SD Hacks 2018 Hackathon in less than 36 hours by Eric Ke, Nathan Zhao, and Ray Sakanoue using Python.

The application uses the camera to take pictures of the user's hands as input, and uses the Clarifai API to identify the image using computer vision.  The sign language gestures are taken, stored, deciphered, and then printed out as text to another window.

Technologies Used include: Python, Clarifai API, and Open CV
